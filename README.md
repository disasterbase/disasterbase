DisasterBase
============

This project is our take on the [DisasterPanel](http://wiki.rhok.org/Disaster_Panel) problem definition.

We implemented it in such a way that all the communications to the front end are JSON, and then [underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore) templates are used to render the data appropriately.

We're using the ubiquitous [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and (Google Maps API)[http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html], with some (Twitter)[http://dev.twitter.com].
